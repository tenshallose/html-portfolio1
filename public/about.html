<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Tenshall Oseiwe, a Web developer, an Engineer in the making and also a creative genius out of practice.
   My intentions behind being a web developer is set on my desire to change the tech world, being a creator and not just 
   a consumer of other people's work. I love to be creative, innovative and free in thinking. It is in my greatest plans 
   to have my name striking the ears as the names like Einstien, Elon, Bezos, do strike. I believe what it takes to make this 
   possible is basically being myself and relying on God, because i'm here for a purpose.
</p>

<p>Glad you have the opportunity to view my very first project, and i hope you catch up with the others to come because
   there will be so many more great works. Many great works, but you will never lose track of them because they will all 
   be relevant and essential. Enjoy this journey of Greatness with me.
</p>

<p>Looking forward, i will like to drop some hints on this pathway i'm on. We will have products made that will be useful,
   essential, and one that makes every consumer feel comfortable and special. Extra is good, i love extra but Essential comes 
   first in my dictionary. I want my character to reflect on my creations/products that way people can know how i think, my values 
   and beliefs. With no intention to impose any of these on others but rather it's an opportunity to influence people to be 
   themselves, soaking in individuality, creativity and purpose, something the world never preach on. See you at the top folks!
